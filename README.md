# SpazzOut
GGJ2015 Ragdoll Game

This is a ragdoll physics game that we created for the Global Game Jam 2015. 
The basic premise was something along the lines of QWOP and Octodad: A barely controllable character and many
opportunities for senseless mayhem.

Controls (v1.x):
- Arrows Up/Down: Move forward / backward
- Arrows Left/Right: Turn right / left
- QWERASDF: fidget with your legs
- Space: fly (to be used only in case of emergency!)
